Roles 								: predefined structure/template to be used to configure any application. Ex: role for apache (whatever is required for apache to run will be in the role, kind of a self sustained container in itself and this can be used anywhere else also as it is.)
Default directory: /etc/ansible/roles
Command to create a role for apache			: ansible-galaxy init apache --offline 

Components of a ROLE:

Defaults : Data about the role/appplication. Ex: Default variables
Files    : Static files whih you might need to be pushed to remote machine
Handlers : Tasks which are based on some actions like triggers and triggers are written under "notify". Ex: If the conf file(httpd.conf) changes for apache, the service should restart, so that code should be written in handler.
Meta     : Information about the role. Ex: author name, supported platforms, dependencies etc.
Taks     : Actual ations whiich need to be performed, i.e., actual code. Ex: installing the package, copying files etc.
Template : Similar to fles except that they support modificatins, i.e., dynamic files. Wriitten in Jinja2 template language.
Vars     : Both defaults and vars store variables, only differnce is variables stored in vars have "higher priority" & are dificult to override.
